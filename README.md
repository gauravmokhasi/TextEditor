TextEditor
==========

Mini project for Systems Programming (CO302)

Built in collaboration with Karan Sabhani, Jay Priyadarshi and Aditya Kadam.

Apart from standard text editing functionality, this Python-Tkinter based text editor also provides a dictionary feature, a basic python syntax highlighter, and base templates for HTML/C/C++/Java files that enable a user to quickly start writing code.
